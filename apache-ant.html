        <h2>Apache ANT</h2>

        <button class="accordion">What is Ant and why is it used?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Ant is a java based <b>build tool</b> developed by Apache for the purpose of automating the build and deployment process.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What is the full form of ANT?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Another Neat Tool</p>

        <button class="accordion">What is the need of automated build and deployment tool?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          Following are the activities that are done by a developer manually after writing the application code:-<br>
          <ol>
              <li>Compiling the application code</li>
              <li>Packaging the binaries (class files)</li>
              <li>Deploying the packaged binaries to <b>test</b> server. (Note that this is not the PROD server)</li>
              <li>Testing the application code on the test server</li>
              <li>Copying the application code from test server to the prod server.</li>
          </ol>
          All of the above activities were done by the developer manually onne after the other. With automated build and deployment tool like Apache Ant, there is no further need to do all these steps manually.

          Follow the steps below:-<br><br>
              1. Goto website <a href="https://ant.apache.org/">https://ant.apache.org/</a><br><br>
              2. Click on the link to download Ant in binary form "https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi." <br><br>

              6. Open terminal and run the command:- <b>export ANT_HOME=/Users/ngksh/Downloads/apache-ant-1.9.14</b> where "/Users/ngksh/Downloads/apache-ant-1.9.14" denotes the path to the extracted folder in step 5.<br><br>
              7. Run command:- <b>export PATH=${PATH}:${ANT_HOME}/bin</b>. Note that "bin" folder is present within the extracted folder.<br><br>
              8. Run command:- <b>ant -version</b>. You should see the version of ant installed on your macbook.<br><br>

          1. Save Ant's build file (with xml extension). As per the industry convention, the name of Ant's build file should be "build.xml".<br><br>
          2. Open terminal.<br><br>
          3. Navigate to the path where you have saved the Ant's build file.<br><br>
          4. Type the following command to run the Ant's build file:-<br>
             <b>ant</b><br><br>
             When you type the command <b>ant</b> on terminal, the system starts searching for the file with name "build.xml" in the path where the command was executed. When the file is found, the instructions written within the file are executed.<br><br>
